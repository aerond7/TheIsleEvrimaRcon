# The Isle Evrima RCON — WPF

A dark-themed WPF desktop client for managing a **The Isle Evrima** RCON server.  
Built on [TheIsleEvrimaRconClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TheIsleEvrimaRconClient) v2.0.0, targeting .NET 8.

---

## Pre-requisites

- [.NET 8 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- RCON enabled on your The Isle Evrima server (see [Enabling RCON](#enabling-rcon-on-an-evrima-server))

---

## Getting Started

1. Install the .NET 8 Desktop Runtime if you haven't already.
2. Download the latest release (or build the project) and place the files wherever you like.
3. Run **TheIsleEvrimaRconWPF.exe**.
4. Enter your server IP, RCON port, and password in the connection dialog and click **Connect**.

---

## Connection Dialog

On startup a connection window appears with three fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Host** | IP address of your server (e.g. `198.244.228.180`) |
| **Port** | RCON port configured on the server (default `8888`) |
| **Password** | RCON password set in `Game.ini` |

- Use **Show password** to toggle password visibility.
- On a successful connection the details are saved to `rcon.con` next to the executable so they are pre-filled next time.

---

## Main Window

The window is split into two panels.

### Left sidebar — Quick Commands

The sidebar shows the connected server name (fetched automatically on load) and connection address at the top, followed by a set of one-click command buttons:

| Button | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Announce** | Broadcasts the message typed in the field above to all online players |
| **Save** | Saves all game data |
| **Wipe Corpses** | Removes all corpses from the world |
| **Player List** | Lists all online players with their Player IDs |
| **Player Data** | Shows detailed stats (class, growth, health, stamina, location) for every online player |
| **Server Details** | Displays the full server configuration |
| **Kick** | Kicks the player whose ID is entered in the field above the buttons |
| **Ban** | Bans the player whose ID is entered (prompts for confirmation first) |

> Player IDs are EOS or Steam IDs. Use **Player List** to look them up.

### Right panel — Console & Command Input

The right side contains:

- **Console log** — colour-coded output of all activity:
  - **Gold** — commands sent
  - **White** — server responses
  - **Green** — success messages
  - **Red** — errors and connection failures
  - **Grey** — timestamps and informational messages

- **Command bar** (bottom) — type any raw RCON command and press **Enter** or **Send**. The raw server response is printed to the console. Type `help` to see a full list of available commands.

## Enabling RCON on an Evrima Server

Open `Game.ini` located at `...\Saved\Config\WindowsServer` and add or edit the following.

Under `[/script/theisle.tigamesession]`:
```ini
bRconEnabled=true
RconPassword=your_password
RconPort=8888
```

Under `[/Script/Engine.Game]`:
```ini
RconEnabled=true
RconPassword=your_password
RconPort=8888
```

> **Note:** The password and port must be identical in both sections.

Also open port `8888` (or your chosen port) in **Windows Firewall** on the server machine.

---

## Important Notes

- RCON is an **unencrypted** protocol — the password and all commands are transmitted in plain text. Avoid using it over untrusted networks; prefer a local network or VPN.
- Connection details (host, port, password) are stored in plain text in `rcon.con` next to the executable.

Requires .NET 8 SDK. The project uses:
